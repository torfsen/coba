Introduction
############
Coba is a backup tool that backs up your files whenever you change them, so
you don't have to remember to do backups anymore and never again lose data
because your backups are too old.

.. warning::
    Coba is in early development and by no means ready for use as your
    primary backup system. It will probably corrupt your data, break
    your heart and eat your homework. You have been warned.

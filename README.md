Coba - a continuous backup system
=================================
Coba backs up your files whenever you change them, so you don't have to
remember to do backups anymore and never again lose data because your
backups are too old.

**Coba is in early development and by no means ready for use as your
primary backup system. It will probably corrupt your data, break your
heart and eat your homework. You have been warned.**

For more information please refer to the
[documentation](http://coba.rtfd.org/).

Coba: continuous backups
########################

*Automatic backups for short timeframes.*

Coba automatically protects your files until your VCS or long-term backup tool takes over.


Warning
=======

*Coba is in early development and by no means ready for use as your
primary backup system. It will probably corrupt your data, break your
heart and eat your homework. You have been warned.*
